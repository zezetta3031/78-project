# Project 78 Repository
This repository houses anything and everything related to the OGPC entry *Project 78* developed by 3 Grant High School "programmers" and wrangled by the arguably one of the coolest teachers ever (fight me). Collectively this trio (plus cool teacher man) is known as *Ready Player Three* (haha get it? cause there's 3 of us hahahhaha).

## Standards
Here at *Read Player Three* we have STANDARDS (anything for the OGPC points).
Code quality is reguarly reviewed using linters and checking for any compiler warnings or complaints. Commit messages use the [standard sematic commit message format](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) (scope is included whenever possible however it can be ommited if a scope doesn't apply).
